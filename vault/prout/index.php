                        <p>Joshua Leonard Prout has recently been up to no good. This 26 year old dude has been found
                            doing bad stuff to kids and even other, older people by scamming them out of their virginity
                            and others out of hardware.</p>
                        <p>You might find him in the shady streets of Texas. That's also the location where he used to
                            commit his first sin.</p>
                        <p>You see... this guy absolutely loves server porn. One could say he's kind of addicted to it.
                            He's so addicted that he started up a company called <b>356NAP</b>.</p>
                        <br>
                        <!-- DATACENTER -->
                        <h3>Datacenter:</h3>
                        <p>So you've heard this guy has way too much time on his hands, huh? Would you be surprised if I
                            told you he even runs a "datacenter"? I bet you aren't surprised.</p>
                        <p>Behold 356NAP. Not only was this guy able to steal loads of Bitcoin and other alt-coin
                            miners, but he also managed to piss off the whole <a

                        <p>356NAP used to offer cheap colocation services and decent dedicated servers. But why did
                            people pick him over some other random datacenter you may ask? That would be because of his
                            very very competitive pricing. You see... Bitcoin miners use up a low of power and space and
                            proud Prout was able to offer both power and space at a low cost, making his company a
                            really compelling option.</p>

                        <!-- SCAM -->
                        <h3>The plot:</h3>
                        <p>As you can imagine people started sending him their own miners and servers to colocate there
                            and our beloved Joshy was just happier with each new victim.</p>
                        <p>You might be thinking: "How come noone sued him?". By that we're not saying he hasn't gotten
                            sued, he just hasn't lost any lawsuits. That's due to him not providing any real legal
                            forms, obligating him to pay for the lost hardware. Due to there not being enough proof, he
                            simply left the courtroom without cuffs.</p>
