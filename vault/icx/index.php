                        <p>People over at LowEndTalk ARE dummies. They were not only able to trick a lot of people, but
                            they were also able to trick a few people over at SummerHoax to make an article about them.

                                brag
                                about having as much downtime as you want.</p>
                            <p>Wait, WTF? Are you saying even their premium tier network has issues? Why yes, yes it
                                does.

                            <p>This dedi is supposed to have at least a 100 Mbps symetrical internet connection. This is
