						<!-- INFO -->
						<h3>Info:</h3>
						<p>Joshua Leonard Prout has recently been up to no good. This 26 year old dude has been found
							doing bad stuff to kids and even other, older people by scamming them out of their virginity
							and others out of hardware.</p>
						<p>You might find him in the shady streets of Texas. That's also the location where he used to
							commit his first sin.</p>
						<p>You see... this guy absolutely loves server porn. One could say he's kind of addicted to it.
							He's so addicted that he started up a company called <b>356NAP</b>.</p>
						<br>

						<!-- DATACENTER -->
						<h3>Datacenter:</h3>
						<p>So you've heard this guy has way too much time on his hands, huh? Would you be surprised if I
							told you he even runs a "datacenter"? I bet you aren't surprised.</p>
						<p>Behold 356NAP. Not only was this guy able to steal loads of Bitcoin and other alt-coin
							miners, but he also managed to piss off the whole <a
								href="https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/152957/psa-avoid-365nap-yet-another-joshua-prout-scam"
								target="_blank">LowEndTalk's community.</a></p>
						<p>356NAP used to offer cheap colocation services and decent dedicated servers. But why did
							people pick him over some other random datacenter you may ask? That would be because of his
							very very competitive pricing. You see... Bitcoin miners use up a low of power and space and
							proud Prout was able to offer both power and space at a low cost, making his company a
							really compelling option.</p>
						<br>

						<!-- SCAM -->
						<h3>The plot:</h3>
						<p>As you can imagine people started sending him their own miners and servers to colocate there
							and our beloved Joshy was just happier with each new victim.</p>
						<p>You might be thinking: "How come noone sued him?". By that we're not saying he hasn't gotten
							sued, he just hasn't lost any lawsuits. That's due to him not providing any real legal
							forms, obligating him to pay for the lost hardware. Due to there not being enough proof, he
							simply left the courtroom without cuffs.</p>
						<br>

						<!-- ICX -->
						<h3>Latest projects:</h3>
						<p>Since 356NAP wasn't doing any good after people realised it was a scam, he closed it down.
						</p>
						<p>Although this guy wasn't done yet. Not too long ago he dipped again. This time in the....
							wait... datacenter market. Again! Really!!</p>
						<p>Say hello to <b>InterConnX</b> everyone. Located at <b>1415 Louisiana Street, Suite #003,
								Houston, Texas 77002</b>. You might be thinking it'd be more obvious this time huh? Not
							really. It's just the address and IPs besides the ASN number and the people behind it
							that are the same.</p>
						<br>

						<!-- PROOF -->
						<h3>Proof:</h3>
						<p>People over at LowEndTalk aren't dummies. They were not only able to track his older projects
							down, but a few of their users have even went to the court, but as previously stated, they
							all failed.</p>
						<p>So I mentioned that their IPs and ASN match up. Here's the picture proof:</p>
						<img alt="InterConnX Scam ASN" src="../assets/img/TA-ASN.png"
							style="max-width: 100%;margin: 0 auto;display: block;">
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>More images proving that the server is still active under that very same name:</p>
						<img alt="Dedicated server" src="../assets/img/OWNERSHIP-PROOF.png"
							style="max-width: 100%;margin: 0 auto;display: block;">
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>I think it's needless to say that people from LET know about it as well.</p>
						<img alt="LET proof" src="../assets/img/LET-TA.png"
							style="max-width: 100%;margin: 0 auto;display: block;">
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>Keep in mind that they are still running InterConnX aka. <b>ICX Realty</b> on the same
							address that isn't even in use according to that place's official <a
								href="http://1415louisiana.com/space.html" target="_blank">website.</a></p>
						<br>

						<!-- SPEEDS -->
						<h3>More rant:</h3>
						<p>If Contabo wasn't bad enough wait till you try out ICX and their premium-tier network. On a
							100 Mbps unmetered not only are you able to host your next SummerHoax, but you can also brag
							about having as much downtime as you want.</p>
						<p>Wait, WTF? Are you saying even their premium tier network has issues? Why yes, yes it does.
						</p>
						<p>This dedi is supposed to have at least a 100 Mbps symetrical internet connection. This is
							what you actually get: <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/result/8220259327.png"
								target="_blank">click me.</a></p>
						<img alt="Speedtest" src="../assets/img/SPEEDTEST.png"
							style="max-width: 100%;margin: 0 auto;display: block;">
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>This dedicated server has an inferior connection than most of you out there. In fact it's 12%
							under the global average. Just look at that upload: <b>5.08 Mbit/s!</b></p>
						<p>If you tought that was really bad, wait till you see the ping to Google: <b>112 ms!</b></p>
						<img alt="Google ping" src="../assets/img/PING.png"
							style="max-width: 100%;margin: 0 auto;display: block;">
						<br>

						<!-- UNDERAGE -->
						<h3>Staff:</h3>
						<p>Not only are they really bad at networking, but they also really suck at making decisions on
							who to hire. They only have 1 (one) single system administrator that's essentially
							responsible for that mess. Like seriously.. A US server pinging Amsterdam Google?</p>
						<p>It's really easy to just find someone off of Minecraft Market. It takes almost no time or
							effort as they usually heavily advertise themselves already.</p>
						<img alt="MC-Market" src="../assets/img/MCM-LUC.png"
							style="max-width: 100%;margin: 0 auto;display: block;">
						<br>
						<p>This indvidual was involved in multiple data breaches, has been caught red-handed at running
							a Petrodacetly daemon on another client's server. This Minecraft hungry guy is not only
							underage to work with any kind of customer information, but should also not be involved in
							any kind of server administration cause he doesn't know exactly what he's doing.</p>
